# Linked List
My implementation of a linked list in c++.

The aim of this project is for me to get a better understanding of the c++ language, this being the first time I produce a project with it (a small one I'll add).

### Current functionalities:
- Push node to the end of the list
- Print the whole list in a standard way
- Sort the list using quicksort
- Return a value for a specified index (works for negative indices as well)
- Randomizer, though basic and seed is time dependent

### Future improvements:
- [x] Randomiser
- [ ] Other sorting algorithms
- [ ] Inserting elements
- [ ] Remove specified elements
- [ ] Remove specified elements

### Future forks:
- Create a list for any type of data (specified by user)
  - Sorting must be sorted out to be more roboust
